# Meeviz - Movie Application

## Overview

Meeviz is a mobile application designed to provide users with an easy and interactive way to browse popular movies, view their details, and track their interactions with the movies they click on. The app fetches movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API and displays movie posters, titles, and brief descriptions. Users can click on any movie to view more detailed information, and their interactions (clicks) are tracked and displayed in a floating button at the bottom of the screen.

## Features

- **Browse Popular Movies**: Displays a list of popular movies with their posters and titles.
- **Movie Details**: When a user clicks on a movie, they are taken to a details page with more information like the movie's release date, rating, and overview.
- **Click Count Tracking**: Tracks the number of movies clicked by the user and displays this count in a floating button at the bottom of the screen.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Automatically loads more movies when the user reaches the bottom of the list.
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Allows users to refresh the movie list by pulling down at the top of the list.
